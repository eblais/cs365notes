How much power does randomness add to computers?
We can examine this question by determining how the class $$\mathbf{BPP}$$ fits in with the other existing complexity classes that we have studied previously.

## BPP and polynomial-size circuits

As we have seen earlier, families of polynomial-size circuits can compute every language in $$\mathbf{P}$$.
They can also compute every language in $$\mathbf{BPP}$$.

> But this means that there can be at most $$2^n \cdot 2^m/2^{n+1} = 2^m/2$$ random strings $$r \in \{0,1\}^m$$ that are bad for _any_ input of length $$n$$.
> Therefore, for at least half of the random strings, $$A$$ correctly accepts or rejects every $$x \in \{0,1\}^n$$.
> We can then design a polynomial-time Turing machine with advice that correctly decides $$L$$ by choosing one of the good random strings to be the advice string $$a_n$$ and then simulating $$A$$ with this advice string in place of the random string.

## BPP and the Polynomial Hierarchy

We can also use the success amplification theorem to place $$\mathbf{BPP}$$ in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.

The proof of that result uses two basic combinatorial lemmas.
For a set $$S \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$$ and a vector $$u \in \{0,1\}^m$$, define the _shift_ of $$S$$ by $$u$$ to be the set

$$
S \oplus u := \{x \oplus u : x \in S\}
$$

where $$x \oplus y = (x_1 \oplus y_1, \ldots, x_m \oplus y_m)$$ is the bitwise XOR of the two vectors.

The first combinatorial lemma states that when $$S$$ is small, the union of a few shifts of $$S$$ does not cover all of $$\{0,1\}^m$$.

> **Lemma 1.**
> Fix any $$n \ge 1$$ and $$m$$ in the range $$n < m < 2^n$$. 
> For any $$S \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$$ of cardinality $$|S| \le 2^{m-n}$$ and any set of $$k = \lceil \frac mn \rceil$$ vectors $$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in \{0,1\}^m$$, we have

> **Proof.**

> \left| \bigcup_{i=1}^k (S \oplus u_i) \right| \le k |S| \le k \frac{2^m}{2^n} = \frac{k}{2^n} 2^m.
> $$
> 
> This cardinality is strictly less than $$2^m$$ when $$k < 2^n$$.

The second combinatorial lemma shows that when a set is large, it is always possible to cover all of $$\{0,1\}^m$$ with a few shifts of that set.

> **Lemma 2.**
> Fix any $$n \ge 1$$ and any $$m \ge n$$.
> For any $$S \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$$ of cardinality $$|S| \ge (1 - 2^{-n})2^m$$, there exist $$k = \lceil \frac m n \rceil + 1$$ vectors $$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in \{0,1\}^m$$ such that $$\bigcup_{i=1}^k (S \oplus u_i) = \{0,1\}^m$$.

> **Proof.**
> Consider what happens when we draw $$u_1,\ldots,u_k$$ uniformly and independently at random from $$\{0,1\}^m$$.
> For any fixed $$r \in \{0,1\}^m$$, the events $$r \notin (S \oplus u_i)$$ are independent and so
> 
> $$
> \Pr[ r \notin \bigcup_{i=1}^k (S \oplus u_i)] = (2^{-n})^k = 2^{-nk}.
> $$
> 
> Therefore, by a union bound argument over all $$r \in \{0,1\}^m$$, the probability that there exists _some_ string in $$\{0,1\}^m$$ that is not included in $$\bigcup_{i=1}^k (S \oplus u_i)$$ is at most $$2^m \cdot 2^{-nk} = 2^{m - nk}$$. 
> From our choice of $$k$$, this probability is at most $$\frac12$$.
> This means that there must exist at least one choice of $$u_1,\ldots,u_k$$ for which $$\bigcup_{i=1}^k (S \oplus u_i) = \{0,1\}^m$$.
> (In fact, it means that there are _many_ such vectors with this property, but we only need that there is at least one for this proof!)

We are now ready to place $$\mathbf{BPP}$$ in the polynomial hierarchy.

> By Lemmas 1 and 2, we get that $$x \in L$$ if and only if there exist $$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in \{0,1\}^m$$ for which every $$r \in \{0,1\}^m$$ satisfies $$r \in \bigcup_{i=1}^k (S_x \oplus u_i)$$. 
> But by definition, $$r \in \bigcup_{i=1}^k (S_x \oplus u_i)$$ if and only if $$M$$ accepts $$(x,r \oplus u_i)$$ for at least one index $$i \in 1,2,\ldots,k$$.
> 
> Since the check that $$M$$ accepts at least one pair $$(x, r \oplus u_i)$$ can be performed in polynomial time, this means that we have obtained a polynomial-time $$\Sigma_2$$-verifier for $$L$$.

## Polynomial Identity Testing

What about $$\mathbf{P}$$ vs. $$\mathbf{BPP}$$?
Can we show that the two classes are identical?
Or that they are different?
The key to doing so appears to be the study of the _polynomial identity testing_ (PIT) problem.

A _(multivariate) polynomial_ is an expression that involves constants and variables multiplied and added together, as in this example:

$$
p(x,y) = 81x^4 + 108x^3y + 54x^2y^2 + 12xy^3 + y^4.
$$

How many addition and multiplication operations do we need to evaluate a given polynomial?
We can evaluate the polynomial $$p(x,y)$$ above in the na√Øve way with a total of 23 multiplications and additions, by computing 

$$
(81 \times x \times x \times x \times x) + 
(108 \times x \times x \times x \times y) +
(54 \times x \times x \times y \times y) + \cdots
$$

But we can also do better by observing that the polynomial $$p(x,y)$$ can also be expressed as

$$
p(x,y) = (3x + y)^4.
$$

This polynomial only requires 4 operations to compute: use a multiplication and an addition to obtain $$3x + y$$. 
Then by multiplying this result with itself, we obtain $$(3x + y)^2$$, 
and one more multiplication applied to this result with itself gives us the final polynomial $$(3x+y)^4$$.

Any strategy for evaluating polynomials can be expressed as an _arithmetic circuit_, whose inputs are constants or variables, and whose gates are addition or multiplication gates.
For example, an arithmetic circuit for the polynomial $$5x + 6xy^2 + z$$ is

![Illustration of an arithmetic circuit](assets/images/arithcircuit.png)

These arithmetic circuits bring up a fundamental question: given two arithmetic circuits, can we efficiently determine if they represent the same polynomial?
This question is equivalent to one that seems even simpler: given an arithmetic circuit $$C$$, can we determine if it is equivalent to the zero polynomial $$p(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 0$$?
And that question can be answered by studying the complexity of the language 

$$
\textsf{PIT} = \{ \left< C \right> : C \mbox{ is the 0 polynomial}\}.
$$

The language $$\textsf{PIT}$$ can be computed in polynomial time with randomized algorithms.

> **Theorem.**
> $$\textsf{PIT} \in \mathbf{BPP}$$.
{: .block-warning}

But, as of now, we do not know if it is possible to decide $$\textsf{PIT}$$ in polynomial time with _deterministic_ algorithms.
This is one of the main open problems in complexity theory today, and a great entry point to the study of randomized algorithms and derandomization.
